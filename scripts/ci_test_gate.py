CI test gate — baseline-diff regression guard.

The RUNECLAW test suite has a set of pre-existing failures that encode behavior
drift (tests asserting older behavior the code intentionally changed). Rather than
block all of CI on them or silently delete them, this gate runs the full suite and
fails ONLY when:

  * a NEW test fails that is not in tests/known_failures.txt, or
  * a baseline entry now PASSES (it must be trimmed — see below), or
  * a collection / internal error occurs.

Roadmap CI-hardening: a baseline test that starts passing is now a HARD failure,
not a warning. Previously the gate self-healed (warned but stayed green), which
let stale baseline entries hide real bugs (e.g. the dedup test that masked a
production bug). The baseline is for tests that consistently fail; the moment one
passes it must be removed, so CI forces the trim. Genuinely flaky tests do not
belong in the baseline — the per-node isolated re-run below filters those.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci_test_gate.py            # run suite + gate
    python scripts/ci_test_gate.py --update   # rewrite the baseline from this run
