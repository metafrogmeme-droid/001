# RUNECLAW deploy helper — make .env and data/ survive redeploys.
#
# The 2026-07-14 incident: a redeploy re-cloned the repo directory, which
# wiped BOTH the .env (secrets) and ./data (position state, shadow book).
# The keys were hand-re-entered with quotes → Bitget 40006 → a live AMD
# position sat unprotected. Root cause: mutable state living inside the
# redeploy path.
#
# This script keeps the real .env and data/ OUTSIDE the repo (in a
# persistent directory the redeploy never touches) and symlinks them back
# in on every deploy. Run it once after each redeploy, before starting the
# stack, or wire it into your platform's deploy/start hook.
#
#   ./deploy.sh              # uses ~/runeclaw-persist
#   PERSIST_DIR=/srv/rc ./deploy.sh
#
# Idempotent and non-destructive: an existing real .env/data is MOVED into
# the persistent store on first run (never overwritten if already there),
# then symlinked. A symlink already pointing at the store is left alone.
