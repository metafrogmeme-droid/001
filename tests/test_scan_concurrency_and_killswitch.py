"""Telegram bot must not freeze while a scan runs, and enabling concurrent
update processing must not let a position survive the kill switch.

Bug: the PTB app was built WITHOUT concurrent_updates, so a handler that runs
an inline force_scan (the 'Latest Signal' button, /scan, /signals) head-of-line
blocked EVERY other update until the scan finished — commands and buttons got no
reply. The fix enables concurrent_updates(True); this suite locks in the guards
that keep it safe:
  * force_scan is single-flight (two concurrent calls -> one scan),
  * the periodic tick skips scanning while a force_scan holds the lock,
  * a fail-closed kill-switch re-check sits immediately before executor.execute,
    so /halt (now able to interleave a confirm) can't be beaten to the order.
