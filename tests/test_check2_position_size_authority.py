"""
Check #2 (POSITION_SIZE) compares against the per-trade cap (deep-audit medium).

position_usd is clamped to max_position_pct (13% default) just before check #2,
but check #2 used to compare it against max_symbol_exposure_pct (20% default) —
so a single capped trade (≤13%) could never reach 20% and the reject branch was
UNREACHABLE, making its "real authority" docstring false. The aggregate
per-symbol limit (max_symbol_exposure_pct) is the job of check #15.

Check #2 now verifies the post-cap margin against max_position_pct: a true
fail-closed invariant that passes in normal operation but rejects if the clamp
is ever bypassed/miscomputed.
