"""
Liquidity sweep checks the sweeping bar's OWN close (deep-audit medium).

A sweep-and-reclaim is a property of ONE bar: it wicks through a swing level AND
closes back on the right side. The detector verified the reclaim with the LATEST
close (closes[-1]) even for a candidate bar 2-3 back, so an old bar's wick plus
the current bar's position could fire a false sweep. With LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_OWN_CLOSE
on, each candidate bar is checked against its own close. Default OFF is
byte-identical.

Data layout (20 bars, lookback 5): a single swing low of 100 at index 7 (the
nearest swing low); the sweep candidates are the last few bars (excluded from
swing detection).
