"""
Model catalog currency guard (2026 refresh).

The admin tier (which the operator's live trade analysis uses) was bumped from
Claude Sonnet 4.6 to the current Sonnet 5. This test guards two invariants so a
future catalog bump can't silently break live LLM calls or cost accounting:

  1. Every model referenced by a routing table has a KNOWN cost (else spend goes
     untracked and budgets misfire).
  2. The admin routing uses the current Sonnet id (not a stale one).
