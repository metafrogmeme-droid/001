"""
scan_all_chart_patterns computes swings once and threads them in (#41).

Each detector used to call _find_swings(highs, lows, lookback) itself — ~14× per
symbol per scan. scan_all_chart_patterns now computes the swings ONCE and passes
them via the optional `swings` kwarg; detectors recompute only when it isn't
supplied. The shared swings is exactly what each detector would have computed, so
results are byte-identical.
