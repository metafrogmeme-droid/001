RUNECLAW Risk Engine -- FAIL-CLOSED pre-trade gatekeeper.

23 independent pre-trade checks. ANY failure = REJECTED. No overrides.
Design: if a check cannot be evaluated, the trade is REJECTED (fail-closed).

Note: Check #17 (liquidity guard) lives in engine.py via OrderFlowAnalyzer,
not in this module.  It is fail-open (no data = pass) by design.

Units (audit V7, F-3) — RECONCILED:
  * Canonical unit: ``position_size_usd`` is MARGIN. The portfolio
    (``open_position``) and the LIVE executor both commit it as collateral and
    derive exchange notional = margin * leverage; ``get_position_value()`` also
    returns margin. The exposure checks (#2/#14/#15) therefore compare margin to
    margin directly — they no longer divide by leverage (that earlier
    normalization treated ``position_usd`` as a notional and understated each new
    position's committed margin by the leverage factor, i.e. the guards were ~5x
    too lenient). So these caps are margin/equity caps, which is also what makes
    the micro design viable ($100 margin -> $500 notional at 5x).
  * Loss-risk checks reason about NOTIONAL: the Portfolio VaR (#21) sums open
    position notionals and now adds the proposed position's notional
    (margin * leverage), not its margin, so it no longer mixes units.
  * The executor enforces a hard notional ceiling (margin * max_leverage) as a
    backstop, and every evaluation logs ``leverage`` + ``approx_notional_usd`` so
    the margin->notional relationship is explicit in the audit trail.

Checks:
  1.  Circuit breaker status
  2.  Position size limit (fixed-fractional, capped at 20% notional)
  3.  Daily loss limit (realized + unrealized PnL)
  4.  Max drawdown limit
  5.  Max open positions
  6.  Risk-reward ratio minimum
  7.  Confidence threshold
  8.  Correlation / concentration per group
  9.  Consecutive loss streak
  10. Entry price sanity
  11. Stop-loss required
  12. Stale data guard
  13. Cooldown after loss
  14. Portfolio exposure limit
  15. Per-symbol exposure limit
  16. Volatility guard (ATR as % of price)
  17. Liquidity guard (fail-open, runs in engine.py via OrderFlowAnalyzer)
  18. Macro event risk state (EVENT_LOCKDOWN/BLACKOUT = reject)
  19. Multi-timeframe trend alignment (MTF_ALIGNMENT)
  20. Portfolio concentration via PCA on correlation matrix (CONCENTRATION_PCA)
  21. Portfolio VaR — parametric Value at Risk (PORTFOLIO_VAR)
  22. Taker 3-bar gate (Gate 2) — 3 consecutive bars confirming direction
  23. Bid dominance gate (Rule 20) — bid:ask >= 2:1 for LONG entries
