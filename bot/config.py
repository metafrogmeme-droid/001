# ── Env precedence (RC-AUD-019, flipped 2026-07-11) ─────────────────────────

# in .env replaces any value inherited from the process/OS environment.
#     .env file  >  process/OS env  >  in-code default
#
# Live incident (2026-07-11): the operator edited the LLM_TIER_* model ids in
# .env, but stale exports inherited from the shell/supervisor silently WON
# (the old override=False precedence), so every tier kept calling a dead model
# id and the bot ran on the rule engine while looking configured. The operator
# edits exactly one file — .env — and that file must take effect on restart.
#
# Escape hatch: set RUNECLAW_ENV_INHERIT=1 in the PROCESS environment to keep
# the old behaviour (process env wins) for deployments that deliberately inject
# config via the environment (docker/systemd/CI). Note that keys NOT present in
# .env are never touched under either mode, so one-off CLI exports for A/B runs
# (e.g. RSI_OVERSOLD_BLOCK=32 python -m bot.backtest.runner) keep working as
# long as the key is not also set in .env.
#
# To tell "inherited from the process env" apart from "loaded from .env" we
# snapshot os.environ BEFORE load_dotenv — afterwards the two sources are
# indistinguishable because load_dotenv injects .env keys into os.environ.
