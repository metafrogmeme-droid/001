"""Read-only position telemetry.

Surfaces the geometry the engine already computes internally — trail stage +
next-trigger threshold, ATR%, liquidation distance, limit-expiry countdown, and
an exchange-sourced "did the trail actually fire" check — formatted to match the
external Playbook readout so the two line up.

PURE by design: every function takes primitives and returns numbers/strings.
No I/O, no clock reads (callers pass timestamps), and nothing here can touch the
order path — so it is safe to surface on a live account.

The trail geometry mirrors bot/utils/trailing.py exactly (multi-stage:
Stage 1 @ 1R, Stage 2 @ 2R, Stage 3 @ 3R), so the threshold/stage shown is what
the bot will actually do.
