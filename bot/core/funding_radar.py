"""
Cross-venue funding radar — compare perp funding across Bitget, Bybit and
Hyperliquid (READ-ONLY, public endpoints, no keys).

Funding is the carry cost of holding a perp. The same coin often funds at
meaningfully different rates per venue, which matters twice:

  1. carry — if the engine can open its long where funding is lowest (or
     most negative), the position gets paid to exist;
  2. arbitrage — long the low-funding venue / short the high-funding venue
     is delta-neutral and collects the spread (the roadmap's funding-arb
     backbone; this radar is its measurement layer).

Complements bot.core.cross_venue (the single-symbol /funding deep view,
ccxt-based with a bulk cache): this module is the MULTI-symbol scan that
ranks spreads. Everything here is informational: one GET/POST per venue, normalized to
annualized percent (APR) so an 8h Bitget rate and an hourly Hyperliquid
rate are directly comparable. Every fetch is fail-soft — a venue that is
unreachable (e.g. Bybit is geo-fenced in some regions) simply drops out of
the comparison rather than erroring the caller.
