RUNECLAW — Advanced Elliott Wave helpers.

Pure, side-effect-free functions that deepen the existing Elliott Wave
pattern detectors (bot/core/chart_patterns.py) along four axes the operator
asked for:

  1. atr_zigzag_pivots     — a structural ATR/%-normalized ZigZag pivot
                              engine, shape-compatible with
                              multi_timeframe._find_swings, so it is a
                              drop-in swings provider for every EW detector.
                              Filters out noise wiggles the fixed 5-bar
                              fractal keeps, which matters most on crypto.
  2. timeframe_for_strategy — maps a strategy_type (scalp/intraday/swing/
                              position) to the candle timeframe whose wave
                              *degree* is the correct one to trade that
                              setup. A scalp reads a lower degree than a
                              swing; giving both the same 1H read (today's
                              behaviour) is the core gap.
  3. wave_action           — turns a detected wave's *position* into an
                              action: end-of-W2/W4 = enter (with-trend),
                              W3-in-progress = enter (momentum), W5 / ending
                              diagonal = avoid/exit (exhaustion). Today a
                              terminal wave 5 still votes plain "bullish".
  4. project_targets       — Fibonacci-projected price targets (W3=1.618xW1,
                              W5 from the W1..W3 range) and the wave-
                              invalidation level (e.g. W2 low for a W3 long)
                              for wave-anchored stops.

Everything here is pure math on plain numbers / dicts. All wiring into the
analyzer is gated behind config flags (ELLIOTT_* — default ON, each
env-overridable), so importing or even calling these functions can never
change live behaviour on its own.
