"""
RUNECLAW Live Executor — places real orders on Bitget via ccxt.

Safety invariants:
  - MICRO_TEST_MODE caps every position at $10 and total exposure at $50
  - Every order is audited before and after submission
  - Market AND limit orders supported (configurable via DEFAULT_ORDER_TYPE)
  - Trailing stops: activates after 1R profit, trails at 1.5x ATR (shared with paper)
  - Fail-closed: any API error aborts the trade and logs the failure
  - The executor never modifies risk limits or bypasses any gate
  - SL/TP are placed as separate stop-market / take-profit-market orders
  - Trailing SL updates cancel+replace exchange strategy orders
  - F-07 FIX: Positions are persisted to disk and reconciled on restart

# were recorded as phantom live fills. We use distinctive substring TOKENS
# (not startswith) so the leading icon/markup does not defeat the match.

# A position-was-CLOSED outcome (EXECUTION ABORTED) counts as a failure: no
# live position remains. The "URGENT — LIVE with NO stop-loss" outcome does
# NOT count as a failure, because a real position exists and retrying would
