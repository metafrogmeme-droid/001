"""Shared close-reason labelling for stop-side exits.

A LONG stop that sits ABOVE entry (or a SHORT stop BELOW entry) is a
profit-locking stop — it can only get there by trailing/breakeven ratcheting,
because the entry-time validators (``bot/utils/models.py``) forbid an inverted
ORIGINAL stop. When such a stop fills, the position closes in PROFIT, so
recording it as a bare "SL HIT" (which every dashboard/tally reads as a loss)
is wrong. This helper is the single place both close/reconcile paths
(``live_executor`` and ``exchange_sync``) use to tell a profit-locking
(trailing) stop apart from a protective loss stop.

Pure functions, no imports — safe to import from anywhere without a cycle.

Incident: TI-a4ba8a82 — a LONG opened at 0.5638 whose trailing stop had
ratcheted to 0.5679 (above entry) filled for a GAIN, but the reconcile path
labelled it "SL HIT (inferred)".
