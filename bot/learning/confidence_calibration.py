"""
Confidence calibration — turn raw model confidence into a realized win-rate.

RUNECLAW blends LLM + confluence into a ``blended_confidence`` in [0,1] that gates
every trade (and, for admins, auto-trade at >= 0.85). But that number is the
*model's opinion*, not a measured probability: a raw 0.85 has never been checked
against how often 0.85-confidence trades actually won. This module fits a
**reliability curve** from the bot's OWN closed-trade history
(``DecisionMemory.confidence`` vs ``pnl_result > 0``) so that a calibrated 0.85
means ~85% historical win rate.

Design / safety:
  - **Monotonic** (isotonic, Pool-Adjacent-Violators): a higher raw confidence can
    never map to a lower calibrated win rate, so trade ordering is preserved and
    noise can't invert it.
  - **Shrinkage toward identity** for thin bins: a bucket with few samples stays
    near the raw value instead of overfitting a handful of outcomes.
  - **Fail-safe identity:** below ``min_samples`` total (or when unfitted),
    ``calibrate(x) == x`` exactly. The curve can only refine a confidence once
    there is enough evidence; it never fabricates one.
  - Pure storage + math. It places no trades and is wired into the decision path
    only behind a default-OFF flag (CONFIDENCE_CALIBRATION_ENABLED); until then it
    runs shadow-only (logs the would-be delta, changes nothing).

This module has no third-party deps (no numpy/sklearn) — PAV is a few lines.
