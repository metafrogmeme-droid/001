# RUNECLAW Audit Report V6.1 — Follow-up Sweep

**Date:** 2026-06-26
**Branch:** `claude/complete-audit-test-report-3hw8kt`
**Predecessor:** `docs/AUDIT_REPORT_V6.md` (same session). V6 covered risk / security /
execution / learning+compliance. This V6.1 sweep covers the subsystems V6 did
**not** reach — the signal-generation core, the backtest engine, NLP/intent
routing, the MCP server, config parsing, and the LLM provider — and runs the deep
backtest harness.
**Method:** Three independent subsystem passes (backtest / analyzer / NLP-MCP-config-LLM),
each finding re-verified at exact `file:line`, plus a 500-run deep backtest
(20 symbols × 5 regimes × 5 seeds).

## Summary

| Severity | Found | Fixed | Documented |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| HIGH | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| MEDIUM | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| LOW | 8 | 7 | 1* |
| **Total** | **19** | **18** | **1*** |

*The single remaining item (LLM-3) is **assessed as not-a-bug** — the `"opus"`
adaptive-thinking gate sits inside the Anthropic-SDK branch and is correct and
conservative; broadening it would risk enabling thinking on unsupported models.
No actionable findings remain.

Two of the MEDIUM fixes (BT-CRASH-1/2) are crashes the **deep backtest run itself
surfaced** — all 6 of its hard errors — and are now fixed (see "Deep backtest run").

**Update (follow-up):** all HIGH and MEDIUM findings are now fixed. Beyond the
original batch, this includes the two HIGH backtest-validity items (BT-H1
commission, BT-H2 wall-clock determinism — `tests/test_backtest_validity.py`), the
MEDIUM config bounds-clamping (CFG-2 — `tests/test_config_hardening.py`) and LLM
tier-fallback (LLM-2 — `tests/test_llm_tier_fallback.py`), and the LOW backtest
metric conventions (BT-L — Calmar/Sharpe/breakeven). The backtest is now
reproducible and accurately costed. The remaining **5 documented items are all
LOW** (AN-2, AN-3, LLM-3, MCP-2, NLP-2) — minor hardening / cosmetic.

Two V6 open questions are now **resolved**:
- The *"intent router returns `''` for `help`"* observation was a **genuine product
  bug**, not a stale test — now **fixed** (NLP-1).
- The *"regime detection returns `UNKNOWN` where a test expected `CHOPPY`"*
  observation is **not a bug in the analyzer core**: `_detect_regime` never emits
  `UNKNOWN` and is consistent with its test. The `UNKNOWN`/`CHOPPY` enum mismatch
  lives in the **separate** `bot/skills/quant_skill.py` regime system (different
  enum `MarketRegime.CHOPPY` vs the analyzer's `Regime.CHOP`). No analyzer change
  needed; flagged for the quant-skill module owner.

## Fixed in this PR

### AN-1 — `analyzer.py` used an undefined `logger` (HIGH, latent crash)
**`bot/core/analyzer.py`** — the module imported `audit, system_log, trade_log,
scan_log` but **no `logger`**, yet seven `except` handlers called `logger.debug/
warning(...)` (LLM-calibration writer at :659, order-flow :711, funding :731,
volume-profile :1736, sentiment :1905, supply-demand :1937). The LLM-calibration
block runs on **every** `analyze()` call; if its inner `try` ever threw
(disk/permission/serialization), the handler itself raised
`NameError: name 'logger' is not defined`, aborting trade-idea generation for that
symbol. **Fix:** added `import logging` + `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
Verified the module imports and `logger` resolves.

### NLP-1 — bare `help` / `commands` misrouted to social chat (MEDIUM)
**`bot/nlp/intent_router.py:386`** — the help rule required `show help` /
`list commands`; the bare tokens `help`, `help me`, `commands`, `menu` matched no
rule and weren't in `trading_words`, so `_is_social_message` returned them as
social chat and `classify_rules` never reached the help skill. The single most
common discovery command silently failed. **Fix:** broadened the help rule with a
**tightly anchored** alternative `^\s*(help|commands?|menu)(\s+me)?\s*$` so the
bare forms route to `help` while longer queries ("help me set a stop on BTC")
are unaffected. Verified across 8 inputs; `tests/test_intent_and_monitor.py::
test_help` now passes.

### LLM-1 — OpenAI-compatible path could return `None` content (MEDIUM)
**`bot/llm/provider.py:521`** — the Anthropic branch returns `raw_text or ""`, but
the OpenAI-compat branch returned `response.choices[0].message.content` directly,
which the SDK can set to `None` (content-filter finish, tool-call-only, empty
completion). Callers that `.strip()` the result (e.g. the intent LLM classifier)
hit `AttributeError`. **Fix:** normalize to `... or ""`, mirroring the Anthropic
branch.

### CFG-1 — non-finite env floats silently disabled risk guards (MEDIUM)
**`bot/config.py:107`** — `_env_float` caught only `ValueError`; `float("nan")` /
`float("inf")` parse without error, and a non-finite risk limit silently disables
its guard (`x > nan` and `x < nan` are both `False`). **Fix:** added an
`math.isfinite` check that logs and falls back to the safe default for any
non-finite value, protecting **every** float field (including the un-bounded
ones — see CFG-2).

### MCP-1 — bad numeric argument bypassed the structured error envelope (LOW)
**`bot/mcp/server.py:347`** — argument coercion (`int()`/`float()`) ran *before*
the execute `try/except`, so a call like `runeclaw_backtest {"bars":"abc"}` raised
an unhandled `ValueError` out of `call_tool`, bypassing the `MCPResponse` error
envelope and the secret-redaction path. **Fix:** wrapped coercion in
`try/except (ValueError, TypeError)` returning a structured error.

### BT-CRASH-1 — `generate_synthetic` divides by zero on underflowed price (MEDIUM)
**`bot/backtest/data_loader.py:148`** — the mean-reversion overlay computes
`(price - start_price) / start_price`. On a very-low-priced asset (PEPE at
1.3e-5) under a sustained downtrend, the −10%/bar cap geometrically decays the
price until it **underflows to 0.0**; that 0.0 becomes the next segment's
`start_price`, so the division raises `ZeroDivisionError` and aborts the run. This
caused **5 of the 6** deep-backtest errors (all PEPE "Crash Recovery" seeds).
**Fix:** skip the pull-back when `start_price` is zero (no reference band exists).
Verified PEPE Crash Recovery now completes (0 trades, degenerate candles correctly
rejected by the analyzer).

### BT-CRASH-2 — analyzer emits an invalid `TradeIdea` on collapsed SL/TP (MEDIUM)
**`bot/core/analyzer.py:943`** — for a low-priced/high-vol asset the ATR-derived
stop/target distance can fall below tick precision, so rounding collapses
`stop_loss`/`take_profit` onto `entry`. The `TradeIdea` directional-sanity
validator then raises (`stop_loss must be below entry`), and the exception
propagates out of `analyze()` → aborts the whole run. This caused the 6th
deep-backtest error (DOGE "High Volatility"). **Fix:** validate the rounded
levels before constructing the `TradeIdea` and skip the degenerate idea (no-trade
is the safe outcome) instead of raising. Verified DOGE High-Vol now completes
(3 trades; degenerate ideas skipped, valid ones proceed). Regression tests in
`tests/test_backtest_edge_cases.py`.

### BT-DISP — deep-backtest printed win rate 100× too low (LOW, reporting)
**`run_deep_backtest.py:193,247,268,295`** — `win_rate` is a fraction in `[0,1]`
(0.8 = 80%) but was printed with a `%` suffix, so the console report showed
`WR=0.8%` instead of `80.0%` (per-run, per-symbol, per-regime, and global lines).
The JSON results were always correct (fraction). **Fix:** multiply by 100 at the
four display sites only; stored fields left unchanged so downstream consumers
(`is_validated`, strategy eval) still receive the fraction.

---

## Backtest validity — BT-H1 & BT-H2 now FIXED

### BT-H1 — configured commission is silently ignored (HIGH) — ✅ FIXED
**`bot/backtest/engine.py:227,478` + `bot/risk/portfolio.py:204` + `bot/config.py:161`** —
`BacktestConfig.commission_pct` (default 0.1), the `--commission` CLI flag, and
`run_deep_backtest.py`'s `commission_pct=0.1` are **never applied to PnL**. The
only commission charged is `CONFIG.risk.commission_pct` (0.06%) inside
`PortfolioTracker`, while the result header *reports* 0.1%. Net: every published
backtest understates costs ~40% vs what it claims, and the cost knob is
non-functional (cost-sensitivity analysis is invalid). **Fixed:** added an
optional `commission_pct` override to `PortfolioTracker` (falls back to
`CONFIG.risk.commission_pct` when unset for live); `BacktestEngine` now passes
`config.commission_pct`, so the fee charged matches the fee reported. Verified
the 0.10% knob charges 2.0 on a 1000+1000 notional round-trip.

### BT-H2 — wall-clock "session" adjustments leak into backtest decisions (HIGH) — ✅ FIXED
**`bot/core/analyzer.py:763` + `bot/risk/risk_engine.py:529` → `session_aware.py`** —
both confidence (±0.02–0.03) and position sizing (×0.75–1.10) call
`get_current_session()`, which defaults to `datetime.now(UTC)` — the **real
wall-clock hour the backtest is launched**, not the simulated `bar.timestamp`.
This (a) breaks reproducibility (same seed → different trades depending on the
hour you run it) and (b) is non-causal (adjusts by a factor unrelated to the
simulated market). **Fixed:** added an optional `as_of` parameter to
`Analyzer.analyze()` and `RiskEngine.evaluate()`, threaded from the backtest's
`bar.timestamp`, so `get_current_session(now=as_of)` uses the simulated time;
live passes nothing → `datetime.now()` as before. Verified: the same seed now
yields **identical** results across runs and is **independent of the wall-clock
hour** (Asian vs London/NY-overlap launch → identical trades/PnL/commission).

### BT-L — metric conventions (LOW) — ✅ FIXED
All three now fixed (`tests/test_backtest_validity.py`):
- **Calmar now annualized** (`engine.py`): annualizes the return over the
  equity-curve span before dividing by max DD, so it's comparable across run
  lengths.
- **Sharpe/Sortino use sample stddev** (`ddof=1`, guarded for <2 observations) —
  was population stddev (`ddof=0`), which overstated the ratios.
- **Breakeven trades are neutral** (`net_pnl == 0`): no longer counted among
  losers nor extending the consecutive-loss streak, matching the risk engine's
  `pnl == 0` handling.

**Verified clean in backtest:** no same-bar SL/TP look-ahead (stops checked on
`i+1`), SHORT PnL signs, slippage applied in the adverse direction both sides,
drawdown peak tracking, timestamp-derived annualization, per-run state isolation
(fresh analyzer/portfolio/risk with isolated temp state file), and reasonable
synthetic-data realism (GARCH vol clustering, Student-t fat tails, OHLC
consistency). Cross-run seed determinism holds **except** for the BT-H2 wall-clock
leak.

## Config / LLM / analyzer / MCP / NLP

All MEDIUM items (CFG-2, LLM-2) and all but one LOW item are now **fixed** (struck
through below). The only remaining item, LLM-3, is **assessed as not-a-bug**.

| ID | Sev | Location | Issue |
|----|-----|----------|-------|
| ~~**CFG-2**~~ | Med | `config.py` | ✅ **FIXED** — the seven risk-gate limits (`max_drawdown_pct`, `min_risk_reward`, `max_portfolio_exposure_pct`, `max_symbol_exposure_pct`, `max_margin_risk_pct`, `max_portfolio_var_pct`, `volatility_guard_atr_pct`) now route through `_env_float_bounded` with generous-but-sane bounds, so a negative value (which inverts the comparison) or absurd typo can't load. Tests in `tests/test_config_hardening.py`. |
| ~~**LLM-2**~~ | Med | `provider.py` | ✅ **FIXED** — the non-admin tier-override return is now guarded by `if tier_key:`, so a key-less override falls through to default routing / primary config instead of running the tier with no LLM. Tests in `tests/test_llm_tier_fallback.py`. |
| **LLM-3** | Low | `provider.py` | ⚖️ **Assessed — no change.** The `"opus"` adaptive-thinking gate sits inside the `sdk == "anthropic"` branch and is correct/conservative; broadening it would risk enabling thinking on models that don't support it. Left as-is by design. |
| ~~**AN-2**~~ | Low | `divergence.py` | ✅ **FIXED** — divergence strength now normalizes by the indicator's recent range (`_div_scale`) instead of `abs(i1)+1e-10`, so near-zero pivots (OBV/MACD) no longer saturate. Verified graduated strength (0.85 vs 0.90 for small vs large). Test in `tests/test_low_findings_v6_1.py`. |
| ~~**AN-3**~~ | Low | `analyzer.py` | ✅ **FIXED** — `_classify_strategy_type` now uses `signal.price` directly instead of the always-0 `indicators["close"]` lookup. |
| ~~**MCP-2**~~ | Low | `server.py` | ✅ **FIXED** — `call_tool` now clamps `bars` to `[1, 5000]` and rejects any `mode` outside `{quick, deep, swing, scalp}` with a structured error (resource-amplification guard). Test in `tests/test_low_findings_v6_1.py`. |
| ~~**NLP-2**~~ | Low | `intent_router.py` | ✅ **FIXED (corrected)** — the duplicate `trade_journal` entry in `valid_skills` was removed. Note: `whynot` **is** a registered skill (`WhyNotSkill` in `skill_registry.py`), so the original "no skill" claim was wrong — it is correctly kept. |

**Verified clean:** MCP auth is fail-closed (refuses to start without
`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`; `hmac.compare_digest` on every call), `runeclaw_execute` is not
exposed, and `_shield_evaluate` is read-only w.r.t. risk state (counters mutate
only in `record_trade_result`, not `evaluate`) — the advisory-only invariant
holds. Config safety-switch parsing (`_env_bool`, `is_live()`) is fail-closed.
Indicator math (RSI/MACD/ATR/EMA/Bollinger/VWAP/ADX/Stochastic), confluence
scoring, confidence clamping `[0,1]`, and LONG/SHORT direction labeling are
correct with proper zero/empty-series guards and **no look-ahead bias**.

## Deep backtest run

The 500-run deep backtest harness (`run_deep_backtest.py`) was executed on this
branch (20 symbols × 5 regimes × 5 seeds, 1500 1H bars each, ~28 min). It
exercises the full analyze → risk → portfolio pipeline per bar across all regimes,
and surfaced two crash bugs (BT-CRASH-1/2 above), now fixed.

**Global summary (this run):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Valid runs | 494 / 500 (6 errors — all now fixed by BT-CRASH-1/2) |
| Total trades | 3,239 |
| Avg return | +3.86% (best +32.93%, worst −1.46%) |
| Avg max drawdown | 1.12% (worst 2.87%) |
| Crashed runs (DD>20%) | 0 |
| Avg win rate | ~70% |
| Avg Sharpe / Sortino | +2.34 / +2.86 |
| Avg profit factor | 29.35 |

**Read these numbers with strong caveats.** The avg profit factor (~29) and Sharpe
(~2.3) are implausibly high for a real strategy and are artifacts of: (a) synthetic
data the rule engine can exploit, (b) BT-H1 — commission understated ~40% (the
config knob is non-functional), and (c) BT-H2 — wall-clock session leakage makes
the run non-reproducible. The results validate that the **pipeline runs end-to-end
without crashing** and that the **risk gates fire** (cooldown, loss-streak, regime
filter, VaR, confidence), but they are **not** evidence of live edge. With the two
crash fixes, a re-run should produce 500/500 valid runs.

*Fixes in this PR are limited to the six contained, verified defects above. The 11
documented items are recommended for focused follow-ups: BT-H1/BT-H2 and CFG-2 are
the highest-value (they affect the validity of published backtest numbers and the
robustness of operator-supplied risk limits).*
