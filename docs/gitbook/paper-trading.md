# Paper Trading

RUNECLAW ships with a fully functional paper trading system. All trades execute against a simulated portfolio with no real money at risk.

## How It Works

The `PortfolioTracker` maintains a ledger that tracks:

- **Cash balance** -- starts at $10,000 (configurable via `PAPER_BALANCE_USD`)
- **Open positions** -- active trades with entry price, quantity, SL, and TP
- **Trade history** -- closed trades with realized PnL
- **Daily PnL** -- cumulative profit/loss for the current day
- **Peak equity** -- highest equity value seen (used for drawdown calculation)

## Opening a Position

When a trade idea is confirmed:

1. The risk engine re-checks all 20 gates.
2. Position size is calculated: `equity * MAX_POSITION_PCT / 100`.
3. Quantity is derived: `position_usd / entry_price`.
4. The position is recorded with entry price, direction, SL, and TP.
5. Cash balance is reduced by the position size.

## Closing a Position

Positions close in two ways:

### Automatic (Stop-Loss / Take-Profit)

The engine's monitor loop continuously checks open positions against current market prices:

- **Long position:** SL hit if price <= stop_loss; TP hit if price >= take_profit.
- **Short position:** SL hit if price >= stop_loss; TP hit if price <= take_profit.

When triggered, the position closes at the current market price and PnL is calculated.

### Manual

Positions can also be closed through the skill system (future enhancement).

## PnL Calculation

```
LONG:  PnL = (exit_price - entry_price) * quantity
SHORT: PnL = (entry_price - exit_price) * quantity
```

After closing:
- Cash balance is restored: `balance += position_size + pnl`
- Daily PnL is updated
- Peak equity is recalculated

## Portfolio Snapshot

The `/portfolio` command returns a `PortfolioState` object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `balance_usd` | Available cash (not locked in positions) |
| `equity_usd` | Cash + value of open positions |
| `open_positions` | Number of active positions |
| `total_trades` | Total closed trades |
| `win_rate` | Percentage of profitable closed trades |
| `total_pnl` | Cumulative realized PnL |
| `daily_pnl` | Today's realized PnL |
| `max_drawdown_pct` | Current drawdown from peak equity |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PAPER_BALANCE_USD` | 10,000 | Starting paper balance |
| `SIMULATION_MODE` | true | Must be true for paper trading |
| `MAX_POSITION_PCT` | 2.0 | Max position size as % of equity |
| `MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS` | 5 | Maximum concurrent positions |

## Persistence

Portfolio state is automatically saved to `data/portfolio_state.json` after every trade execution (open and close). On startup, the tracker loads the last saved state if the file exists. This means portfolio balance, open positions, trade history, and drawdown tracking survive restarts.

- **Atomic writes:** State is written to a temp file and renamed, preventing corruption from crashes mid-write.
- **Graceful recovery:** If the state file is missing or corrupted, the tracker starts fresh with the default balance.
- **Configurable path:** Set `PORTFOLIO_STATE_FILE` in `.env` to change the default location.
- **Thread-safe:** All persistence operations run within the existing RLock.

## Limitations

The paper trading system is designed for demonstration purposes:

- **No slippage model.** Trades execute at the exact signal price. Real markets have slippage.
- **No fees in paper mode.** Trading fees are not deducted in paper trading. The **backtest engine** does model commission (0.1%) and slippage (0.05%), with commission computed once by the portfolio tracker to avoid double-counting.
- **No partial fills.** All orders are fully filled instantly.

These simplifications are appropriate for a hackathon demo but would need to be addressed for real-world use.
