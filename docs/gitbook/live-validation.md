## Connection Details

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Exchange | Bitget |
| Account Mode | Unified Account |
| API Mode | Authenticated (live trading enabled) |
| Sandbox | false (real market data) |
| Simulation Mode | false (live micro-test) |
| Live Trading | true (enabled, core team only) |

> **Note:** The authenticated balance endpoint is unavailable because the sub-account uses Bitget's Unified Account mode, which requires v3 API endpoints not yet supported by ccxt. All market data (tickers, OHLCV) works correctly via public endpoints, which is the only data RUNECLAW needs for scanning and analysis.
