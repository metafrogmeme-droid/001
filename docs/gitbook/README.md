# Introduction

**AI Trading Command Core | Forged in Volatility. Governed by Discipline.**

*by Humanoid Traders | built for Bitget AI Base Camp / Agent Hub*

Welcome to the official RUNECLAW documentation.

RUNECLAW is a risk-first AI trading assistant designed for the **Bitget AI Base Camp · Hackathon S1**. It scans Bitget markets for opportunities, generates trade theses using LLM analysis and technical indicators, applies macro and volatility context, enforces strict risk controls, and requires human confirmation before any trade can proceed.

The system runs in **paper trading mode by default** and is built around safety, transparency, explainability, and disciplined execution.

> **RUNECLAW is not another hype bot. It is a survival-first AI trading agent.**

## Core Principles

1. **Simulation-first.** Live trading is disabled unless explicitly enabled with two environment flags.
2. **Fail-closed risk.** Every trade must pass all 20 pre-trade checks (17 fail-closed + 1 fail-open for liquidity only). One failure means rejection.
3. **Human-in-the-loop.** No trade executes without explicit confirmation via Telegram inline keyboard.
4. **Full auditability.** Every decision is logged as structured JSON for post-mortem review.
